After NH-58 was denotified as a highway last year, it was assigned as ?other district road? to the PWD as per a state government notification in June.Due to massive inflow of traffic on the Ghaziabad-Meerut Road (erstwhile NH-58), officials of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) had proposed the construction of a flyover and also altered the design, by making it a split-type flyover, as the regional rapid transit system (RRTS) corridor passes through the median of the road.?We have given clearance for the project to the GDA. They will have to prepare a service lane in the area and also have to take care of the piped gas line that passes through the area. They will make use of additional land in the vicinity and also remove encroachments. We also reviewed their traffic plan and have given them the permission after a thorough study,? said Manish Verma, executive engineer, PWD.?We also checked the RRTS alignment and had also asked them to take permission from the agency concerned. The clearance was given on a review of the traffic regulation plan and provision for the RRTS alignment. We are also planning to make the road a state highway and will send a proposal to the government. This is because the volume of traffic has remained the same despite the road being denotified as a highway,? he said.The proposed flyover, spanning 538 metres, is pegged at Rs50 crore and its design was changed from combined six-lane to three-lane (each side) split-type one. The middle portion between the two lanes will be used for the RRTS, which will come up on an elevated section, like the metro train system.The authority had proposed the flyover to decongest the city roads as a heavy volume of traffic is witnessed at the intersection.?The design for the flyover has been approved by the RRTS agency. The flyover design report is waiting to be vetted by IIT, Roorkee. The UP state bridge corporation is the construction agency. Once the design is vetted, the flyover construction can be started. We have received clearances from PWD for the project,? said Chakresh Jain, executive engineer, GDA.The authority has also proposed a flyover in Vasundhara, over the Link Road. Officials said that the proposed design is not in conflict with the RRTS alignment and pegged the cost at Rs50 crore.\",\n          \"New Delhi, Jun 30 (PTI) As India transits to a new era with rollout of GST, the government is leaving no stone unturned for a smooth switchover and has asked tax offices to convert into GST Seva-Kendras to provide all assistance to tax payers. While the rollout day of July 1 will be known as GST Day, all the offices of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) have been instructed to be open on Saturday as a trade facilitation measure. This was to enable the availability of officers and staff for the benefit of trade and industry, an order issued by CBEC Special Secretary and Member S Ramesh said. \\\"Henceforth, all field offices from the Chief Commissioners office to the Range should serve as GST Seva- Kendras for effective trade facilitation,\\\" it said. Apart from giving guidance to GST assessees, GST Seva Kendras should render assistance to taxpayers in migration, registration as well as filing of returns. A guidance manual for such GST Seva Kendras too has been circulated to all offices in a bid to standardise quality taxpayer services. The order instructed such manuals to be prepared for each zone operating at different levels. \\\"This work may be done in a time-bound manner so as to be completed in next 2-3 days,\\\" Ramesh wrote. CBEC also asked for strengthening of the GST Seva-Kendras to enable them discharge their functions effectively and promptly. In the run-up to the GST rollout, CBEC had organised outreach programmes and training sessions for the new regime. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["raw.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"BAvTTFrViugO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710362399389,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":816,"user":{"displayName":"Ak Tonay","userId":"00927712866818112749"}},"outputId":"a4671e3f-2269-4b55-cc2d-edb24c0b52a5"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                           headlines  \\\n","0  upGrad learner switches to career in ML & Al w...   \n","1  Delhi techie wins free food from Swiggy for on...   \n","2  New Zealand end Rohit Sharma-led India's 12-ma...   \n","3  Aegon life iTerm insurance plan helps customer...   \n","4  Have known Hirani for yrs, what if MeToo claim...   \n","\n","                                                text  \n","0  Saurav Kant, an alumnus of upGrad and IIIT-B's...  \n","1  Kunal Shah's credit card bill payment platform...  \n","2  New Zealand defeated India by 8 wickets in the...  \n","3  With Aegon Life iTerm Insurance plan, customer...  \n","4  Speaking about the sexual harassment allegatio...
